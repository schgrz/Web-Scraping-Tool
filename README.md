# Web-Scraping-Tool

This is a simple web scraping tool for analysis. The purpose of this project was to practice creating and implementing a web scraping tool.

This tool scrapes a HTML website that has shows books, titles, their ratings, their prices, and other information.

My goal was to scrape the titles and match their ratings and prices and compile them into a list that I could export to a CSV file for future analysis.
